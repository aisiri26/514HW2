Run 7_4.py with Python 2.7

Running the code displays the centroids.
I implemented the kmeans algorithm by setting initial centroids, then repeatedly updated them and checked for convergence each time. There are no max iterations, the algorithm runs until convergence is achieved.

Run 7_4_plot.py to see the plotting implementation. Office hours said we could use sklearn for this part. Kmeans computes the sum of squares asked so I just plotted those.
